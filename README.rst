Installation
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Poetry
~~~~~~

The *OpenColorIO Configuration for ACES* repository adopts `Poetry <https://poetry.eustace.io>`__
to help managing its dependencies, this is the recommended way to get started
with development.

Assuming `python >= 3.10 <https://www.python.org/download/releases>`__ is
available on your system the development dependencies are installed with
`Poetry <https://poetry.eustace.io>`__ as follows:

.. code-block:: shell

    git clone https://github.com/KelSolaar/unreal-engine-docset.git
    cd unreal-engine-docset
    poetry install

Usage
^^^^^

The module expects a **Unreal Engine** *tgz* file as an input, they are
typically found in the ``Engine/Documentation/Builds`` directory, e.g.
``Engine/Documentation/Builds/CppAPI-HTML.tgz``, and an output directory:

.. code-block:: shell

    python unreal_engine_docset.py --input "/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.3/Engine/Documentation/Builds/BlueprintAPI-HTML.tgz" --output "/Users/Shared/Epic Games/UE_5.3/Engine/Documentation/Builds"
